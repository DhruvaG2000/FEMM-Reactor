# FEMM-inductor-tutorial
An FEMM simulation of an Air Core Inductor

## Introduction

Finite Element Method Magnetics (FEMM) is a finite element package for solving 2D planar and axisymmetric problems in low frequency magnetics and electrostatics.

## Model Construction and Analysis

This will take you through a step-by-step process to analyze the magnetic field of an aircored solenoid sitting in open space as shown below.
